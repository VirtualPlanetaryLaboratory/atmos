373.0    = G, Gravity - Earth=980.7, Mars=373.0
0.43     = FSCALE, Solar Flux Scaling - Earth=1.0, Mars=0.43
0.215    = ALB, Surface Albedo - Earth=0.25, Mars=0.215 !accrding to Kevin's mars model
1.5E6    = ZTROP, Height of the tropopause - typically Earth=11km, Mars=15km
0.01     = FAR       Ar partial pressure on modern Earth 1% for Mars 1.6 according to Kevin's model
3.3766E8 = R0    Planet Radius Earth 6.371e8, Mars 3.3766e8
0.0063   = P0  = surface pressure of modern Earth in atm ( 0.0063 for Mars)
MARS     = PLANET  string naming the planet for extra changes (MARS is the only other option for the moment)
0.0      = TIMEGA - time in Ga, for modifying the solar flux
0        = IRESET
13       = msun

-below here are not read in.  They are from Shawn's Planet.earth file but are handled differently here.

choices for msun (these numbers are from photgrid.f)
      msun = 12    !Gj 581 from Lucianne
      msun = 13    !high resolution solar data from ATLAS1/3 (Thullier et al 2004)
      msun = 14    !kevin's data from photo.dat
      msun = 15    !AD Leo from VPL climate DB
      msun = 16    !AD LEO from VPL website
      msun = 17    !T3200.dat

      msun = 21    !M5V
      msun = 22    !G0V star for wasp12b (first Hot Jupiter model)

11    = JTROP, Grid layer marking the tropopause height, depends on ZTROP and DELZ
1.0E5 = DELZ, Height of each atm layer - Earth=1.0E5, Mars=2.0E5 (cm)
